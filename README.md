This notebook is an example of using [quilt](https://quiltdata.com/) and
[mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) to manage data and perform a simple analysis
using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). It takes data from the [National Center
for Health Statistics](http://www.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-natality-data.html),
and performs a simple (and quite possibly faulty) analysis of it.


The data consists of around 4M birth records for the year 2016 published
through the [National Bureau of Economic
Research](http://www.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-natality-data.html). The
who list the following conditions:
